## Parallel Programming Code

This code was created as part of a parallel programming course concerning threading in C. Threading is implemented using POSIX threads. Please keep in mind that this code was not developed with real‑world use, and there might be slight implementation errors (especially concerning code that was meant to test custom libraries). Some general scripts for testing the code are also included

## Building the code

You can build any individual "task" using make in the designated folder, provided you have gcc installed. For testing the code you can usually just run 
```bash 
bash scipt_name
```
, though there are exceptions (make test for 1.1 for example). Please note that most "tasks" dont have any extra scripts for testing.
